The code and data in this folders are from Kaggle Code Competitions active in June 2022.

As the field moves so quickly and develops in so many direcitons, it is practically impossible for one person to stay up to date.  Therefore,
the purpose of this exercise was to review high quality competition level code.

I selected different competitions to get a variety of applications, reviewed the top notebooks for each competition and selected my favorite, 
and then reviewed the code in depth adding my own comments to it.

To be clear - I did NOT originally write these notebooks, instead I selected them as examples of best practices and state of the art implementations
to learn from.

The intention was to identify starting points and best practices to use myself on any similar applications, and so I made sure to identify 
what each notebook excelled at.
