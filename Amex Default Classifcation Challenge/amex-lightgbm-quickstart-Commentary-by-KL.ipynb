    "# Reviewed/Commented by KL on 6/2/2022\n",
    "\n",
    "The American Express Default Prediction Kaggle Challenge asks participants to create a model to predict credit card defaults.  This notebook provided by a competition participant does a fantastic job of doing EDA, although with the data anonymized the amount of feature exploration will be limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/code/ambrosm/amex-eda-which-makes-sense\n",
    "\n",
    "The main takeaways for the competition is that the selection criteria is a combination of ROC and Recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, while in the training dataset of 458k customerIDs, 74% are good customers without a default, and 26% of customers are bad customers that did have a default (defined as not making a payment for 120 days in a row), the good customer were subsampled at a rate of 20.  Therefore, in reality the ratio is 98% good, to 2% bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, the provided datasets is rather large, at a total of 50.31 gigs.  A few different public competition notebooks provided competitors with more efficient datasets, specifically parquat and feather.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parquat\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction/discussion/327138\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feather\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction/discussion/327143\n",
    "\n",
    "The original total dataset was 50.31 gigs.  Parquet was able to reduce it down to 10.41 gbs, and Feather was able to reduce it down to 5.4 gbs.  Additionally, the datatypes for both included reducing numeric columns to float16, and categorical to 'category' which will of course reduce data as the datatypes are more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Main takeaway here is to remember that you are often given raw datasets and there is often much room for improvement, especially in file size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset itself was 5.5m rows for training and 11m rows for test.  It appears that each row is a monthly customer statement, but without overlap in the time periods.  The test data is after the train data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Leading Competition notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 leading competition notebooks publically available as I write this, one based on LGBM, and one based on RNN.  The LGBM notebook is below and will have some of my comments added (denoted with a KL), and the RNN notebook will also have a link to the notebook.  I reviewed the RNN, but I will note provide a notebook with commentary in the interests of time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### LGBM Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the one that is below.  Here, we can view the notebook fully run.\n",
    "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction/code?competitionId=35332&sortBy=voteCount\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### RNN notebook\n",

    "https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction/discussion/327761\n",
    "\n",
    "Score LB 0.789\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison \n",
    "\n",
    "The RNN notebook requires signficantly more effort for data preparation.  The author of the LGBM author actually provides a great rundown of the difference between data prep for LGBM vs a NN that I will copy below:\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "Preprocessing for LightGBM is much simpler than for neural networks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks can't process missing values; LightGBM handles them automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical features need to be one-hot encoded for neural networks; LightGBM handles them automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "With neural networks, you need to think about outliers; tree-based algorithms deal with outliers easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks need scaled inputs; tree-based algorithms don't depend on scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "----\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the LGBM actually scores a tad better than the RNN.  Further, while this isn't part of the competition, it is generally easier to provide an explanation of how a tree based model is making it's decisions over a NN, although IT IS possible, just more computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows once again why I greatly prefer using LGBM when it makes sense.  Less data prep and trains much faster than XGboost.\n",
